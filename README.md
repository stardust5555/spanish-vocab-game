# Spanish Vocab Game
Hi! This is my Spanish vocab game! (Or at least it will be ðŸ˜…)

It's a work in progress at the moment, but eventually it will become an interactive quiz to test you on your GCSE Spanish vocab!

## Run locally
First clone done the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/stardust5555/spanish-vocab-game.git
```
Next install the dependancies
```
npm i
```
Run the app
```
npm start
```
## Next Sprint
- Completing the quiz for each of the different places
- Unit testing
- Making it more accessible

## Further Sprints
- Deployment
- End to end Cypress testing
- Setting up a database for the quiz questions

## What I've learnt so far...
- This project started as a way to familiarise myself with React, in particular state and hooks. 
- I've learnt how to use React Router to route to different pages
- The importance of commenting code! ðŸ˜† Having come back to this project after 2 months. I'm really glad that I took the time at the beginning to comment everything that I did. It's made it so much easier to come back and understand where I left off
